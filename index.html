<p> This file will give the overview of the project.</p>
<h1>Goal</h1>
	<p> The goal of the project was to analyze the timing of NIOS-f processor in DE1-SoC board. The processor runs at 100Mhz (period t = 10 nanoseconds).</p>
<h1> Step 1</h1>
	<p> A simple application to toggle output on a pin was created. For this, the parallel port at location 0xff200060 is used. One of the pins, D0, was configured as output.</p>
	<p> Using a simple infinite loop, the output on D0 was toggled. The goal was to see the maximum achievable toggle frequency.</p>
	<h2> Code 1</h2>
		<p> Following is the code that was used for this purpose. The final code in the <a href="timing_nios.s"> source file </a> might have been edited already.</p>
		<p> In the code, r15 contains the address of parallel port where the oscilloscope is connected. <br> r13 contains a value 0x01 </p>

	<h2> Observation 1</h2>
		<p> Following is the output obtained as observed in the oscilloscope.</p>

	<h2> Computation 1</h2>
		<p> From the image in Observation 1, we can see the period of the signal is <b> 112.5 nanoseconds.</b>, which is the time for a complete cylce of waveform. This indicates the time taken by the three lines of assembly code is 112.5/2 = <b>56.25 nanoseconds</b>.</p>

<h1> Step 2</h1>
		<p> The <a href="timing_nios.s"> code </a> was slighly modified. A nop instruction was added before the value is toggled. In NIOS, a nop instruction does not exist. This means, the nop instruction will be replaced by <i>add zero, zero, zero</i>.</p>
	<h2> Code 2</h2>
		<p> Following is the code that was used for this purpose.</p>
			<img src="images/code_2.PNG" alt="Should be image for code 2" height="100" style="display: block;margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;">
	<h2> Observation 2</h2>
		<p> Following is the output obtained as observed in the oscilloscope.</p>
			<img src="images/osc_2.jpg" alt="Should be observation for code 2" height="200" style="display: block;margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;">
	<h2> Computation 2</h2>
		<p> From the image in Observation 2, we can see the period of the signal is <b> 140 nanoseconds.</b>, which is the time for a complete cylce of waveform. This indicates the time taken by the four lines of assembly code is 140/2 = <b>70 nanoseconds</b>.</p>
		<p> This shows that adding one nop instruction takes additional 
		<br> <i> 70-56.25 nanoseconds</i> 
		<br> <i>  = 13.75 nanoseconds </i>
	</p>
